User guides

* `ginfo <http://gridinfo.web.cern.ch/information-system-users/ginfo>`_: A
  client to query GLUE 2.0 information from the BDII.

  clients to query GLUE 1.3 information from the BDII. This guide also contains a

  maintained in a best effort basis.

WLCG evolution
--------------

In June 2015, OSG announced their plans to stop using the BDII to publish their
computing resources (See `Slides <files/WLCGOpsCoord-OSGBDII.pdf>`_ presented
at the WLCG Operations Coordination Meeting in 18th of June). This announcement
has triggered the review of the current WLCG Information System. It has been
decided to create a `task force <https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/EGEE/WLCGISEvolution>`_
to evaluate how WLCG is going to evolve to be able to cover the existing use
cases and finally improve all the existing drawbacks and weaknesses of its
current implementation.
